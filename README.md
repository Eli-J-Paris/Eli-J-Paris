 From a young age Iâ€™ve been inspired to help other people. This led me to pursue a career in human services with the goal of becoming a therapist. While the knowledge I gained was valuable I was disappointed with the limitations of the industry and felt as if my skill set would be under utilized. So After two years of studying I arrived at a point in my life where I realized that if I wanted to help people I would need a career that would play not just to one of my strengths but to all of them. So I decided to take some time to seriously evaluate who I was and who I wanted to be. I knew I still wanted to help people, but I wanted to create as well. I wanted to spend time exploring new challenges and challenge myself to constantly be learning and growing as a person. This eventually led me to pursue a career in software development. Through this journey I have found myself enriched by endless possibilities through which I can help people with the programs I write and by the freedom to work creatively on constantly shifting problems.
